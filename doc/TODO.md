# TODO

1. Fix Monte Carlo simulation
2. Refactor/reorganize source code
3. Modernize code (C++20, smart pointers, efficient math and geometric algorithms)
4. Make sure that the old configurations / input files work, especially those with multiple layers and photons
5. Convert config file to ini
6. Replace custom geometry definition with 3D model loader (glTF)
7. Add Vulkan renderer to replace OpenGL implementation
8. Add a ray tracer that can create an image from the current viewpoint based on the photons traced and emittance data.
